== twfy_local_parser is a scraper/parser for local authorities.

At the moment itâ€™s in the early stages, concentrating on developing a scraper/parser system where the scraper/parsers are stored in the db (via a web interface).

BUGS
When adding join model (e.g. committee memberships), currently added even when test processing. Plus no reporting, as reporting uses Dirty, which doesn't act on associations
When doing test scrape of member info new info (eg email addresses) shows up, but doesn't when processing
