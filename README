== twfy_local_parser is a scraper/parser for local authorities.

A live version can be seen at http://openlylocal.com

At the moment itâ€™s in the early stages, concentrating on developing a scraper/parser system where the scraper/parsers are stored in the db (via a web interface).

BUGS
* When adding join model (e.g. committee memberships), currently added even when test processing. Plus no reporting, as reporting uses Dirty, which doesn't act on associations
* When doing test scrape of member info new info (eg email addresses) shows up, but doesn't when processing
